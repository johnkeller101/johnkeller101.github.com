description: The route this month was a lung busting 12,000 ft. of climbing and over 90 miles. The ride started at Flatirons Subaru who were generous enough to provide a support vehicle to follow us with food and water. We then headed west up Boulder Canyon to Sugarloaf.

#### Risk

Let's face it: when you sign up for a race you know the risks involved. You can travel up to 40 mph with strangers riding inches from you. In training, it's easy to know how teammates ride and predict their every move. In a race, you are puting your body and mind in the hands of others, and sometimes it doesn't work in your favor. It's hard to analyize something in the heat of the moment, and usually post-crash you don't even want to see the faces of the people who you feel are responsible. 

#### Analysis

I'm not going to blame anyone, because in a race shit happens. Nobody is thinking completely clearly and people tend to act selfishly (or soley with their team in mind). You can look for yourself at the video below, but also note that there was another rider on my left side. I got shoved in the middle and the rider on the left ignored my yelling for him to move. We were going into a left hand turn, so the rider did not want to be too far on the inside, but seemed to not recognize that the peleton on the right of me was not going to budge.

#### Recovery

When you have great teammates like Michael, recovery is a breeze. Living along makes concussion symptoms hard, but when you have someone looking out for you it makes things a lot easier. For the first two days post-crash, I had the usual concussion symptoms. I couldn't listen to any audio, and my air conditioner drove me nuts. I wore my sunglasses inside, and couldn't look at screens for more than a few brief moments. My head was cloudy and I couldn't write sentences. It's a little crazy that you go into a bike race knowing this stuff can happen after, but these things in the end make you stronger, and as I upgrade, hopefully the frequency of such crashes decreases.
