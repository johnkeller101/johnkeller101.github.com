description: The route this month was a lung busting 12,000 ft. of climbing and over 90 miles. The ride started at Flatirons Subaru who were generous enough to provide a support vehicle to follow us with food and water. We then headed west up Boulder Canyon to Sugarloaf.

#### A Brief Overview

My first season racing a bike went really well. I certainly had my ups and downs, but that's what makes the sport fun. 

#### The Early Season

The season started early for me with my first race on March 4th for the DU Cycling City Park Crit. I did two races that day, the first as a Collegiate C and the second as a Category 5. In the Collegiate race, CU had a break of four including me, and we easily won. The Category 5 race did not go as smooth as planned, as I spent nearly the entire race sitting on the front, which is a definite rookie mistake. 

The next weekend we were upgraded to Collegiate B after our dominant performance. It was the CSU race weekend, which featured a crit and road race. I DNF'd the road race due to mechanical issues (along with many others due to a bone rattling and flat-causing dirt section). In the crit, I started to figure out how to work as a team. Two teammates went in a break and I stayed back to cover moves. It was extremely hard, especially considering physiologically I am not built for that many hard surges.

#### Spring Break Madness

One of the biggest highlights for me personally was my spring break performance. I headed west for some of the best training in the US: Malibu, CA. It was a nearly 2,000 TSS week of training, with 446 miles and 43,000 ft of elevation gain. This was the first time I saw the incredible effects of elevation, as the power I could hold jumped by over 15%. It was the most insane week of riding I have ever done, and I am looking forward to spring break next year!

#### Back to Racing

The next weekend after spring break was the Mines Lookout Uphill Time Trial. Not much to say here except my legs were still fatigued and I had an extremely sub-par performance from where my fitness was. I still finished 4th with an okay time, but I will come back and take revenge on this one later in the season!

Next up was the Front Range Cycling Classic at the US Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. It was a two day affair with the first day consisting of a sketchy crit. I somehow decided doing the crit twice would be the best way to go about it, so I raced the 4-5 and Collegiate B races. This crit had a 180 degree turn which was horrendous and had potholes right in the apex of the turn, but somehow I kept everything upright. I won the 4-5 race solo off the front, and my first win felt great! I also now finally had enough races under my belt to upgrade to 4 (that one took forever).
