The Boulder Roubaix Road Race, first held in 1990, is an 25.4 mile loop with 47% dirt roads and 53% paved. Neutral support is based on volunteer availability and is unlikely. Please bring a pump and spare tube. Do a “bolt check” and bottle cage press.  Held every other year. The 2015 edition saw almost 1000 racers from 15 states.
