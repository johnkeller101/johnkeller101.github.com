One of most ridden routes in all of Boulder, with the start located just miles from downtown!  Don't miss out on this early season ascent that is the perfect test of fitness and strength!

The [Sunshine Hill Climb](https://www.sanitascycling.com/sunshine-hill-climb) is one of the more beginner friendly climbing routes in Boulder County, but seasoned veterans don't despair, you'll be challenged on the steep pitches just past Poorman's and near the finish line!  The overall course is 9 miles, ascending 3,000 ft with roughly 3 miles on hard packed dirt.
