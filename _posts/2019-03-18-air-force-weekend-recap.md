The first race weekend of the 2019 season was a major success for the CU Cycling Team. We excelled in the semi-technical crit on Saturday, winning **every** collegiate race. To start things off, Megan Percy convincingly won the Women's C race, followed closely behind by Jess Ryan for second. Kylen Solvik started off a great weekend by winning the Men's C race with teammate Nikolai Lyssogor by his side, ahead of the next rider by 15 seconds. Jenny Lucke then went solo off the front to win the Women's B race. The Men's B race was fast this year, with Spencer White going solo off the front to win. Close behind was John Keller and Peter Gara, to complete the podium. The Men's A race was a heated battle full of attacks, but Grant Ellwood won the field sprint to take home the win. The Women A’s race was set at a hard pace, but Anna Christian played it smart and touched wind for the first time to win the heated field sprint. 

After such a successful day for the team on Saturday, it was a difficult road race on Sunday. To top off an extremely strong weekend, Kylen Solvik once again won the Men's C race, with Nikolai Lyssogor close behind to take second. Dara Procell went solo from the group to win the Women's C race with a 4 minute gap. For the Men's B race, CU swept the extended podium, taking places 1-5 in the order of Parker Gara, Marshall Graybill, Spencer White, John Keller and Simon Castagneri. Jenny Lucke finished off a great weekend in the Women's B with a sprint finish win at the line. Ross Ellwood finished third in a hard and fast Men's A race, complete with a breakaway chase and capture. Anna Christian finished 7th in a hard Women A’s road race after a great result on Saturday.
