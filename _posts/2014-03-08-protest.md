This movie was created as my Junior Project for Denver School of the Arts. This basically means it's the first movie I have to make from the beginning to end, script to post. One day, my little brother came home from school complaining how they weren't allowed to play on the playground before school, and my mind stated to wander in regards to this topic. This project was of sorts like a mocumentary - although I hate the name - based on this idea, with a fun twist. Have a look for yourself!
