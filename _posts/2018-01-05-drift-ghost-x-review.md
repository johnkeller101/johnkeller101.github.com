### First Impressions

<img width="" src="/assets/drift-ghost-x/buttons.jpg">

To start off, for a $100 device, this camera seems on the surface to be incredibly capable. It boasts a 5 hour battery (with an expansion available to extend it to 8), tagging features (which I haven't seemed to use), and an extremely compact (and lightweight) size.

### Biggest Disadvantages

#### 1. Camera Quality

When compared to even an entry level go-pro, the camera quality is certainly lacking. It is advertised as 1080p, but the quality seems to be more like 720p at best.  

Reading license plate numbers when vehicles are traveling at high speed seems to be hit-or-miss, with many being unreadable. This camera only records at 30 frames per second. This may not seem like a major downside, but when trying to extract license plates, this means you have less frames to review, and the frames will often end up being more blurry. Despite this, when you think about the use case, it is more likely that you simply need documentation of wrong-doing, and already have documentation of the license plate number.

#### 2. Mounting

This camera *does not* come with a go-pro style mount and only comes with the inbuilt tripod thread mount. There are mounts available, and this is the one I use (it is higher than I would like on the handle bars but it does it's job).

#### 3. 

#### 3. Auto-Pause

One of the major alternatives, the Cycliq Fly 12, has auto-pause on recording when the device is not moving for a long period of time. This means that your coffee stops don't get recorded, and saves the battery for when you are actually riding. Despite this flaw, you can certainly stop the recording on your own, but you just need to remember to start it again once you get rolling.


### Why I'm Keeping It
