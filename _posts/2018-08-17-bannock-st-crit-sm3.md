The Bannock St. Crit in memory of Mike Nields, is held in the Golden Triangle in Denver.   The Golden Triangle is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Denver, and is now filled with restaurants, art galleries, and offices. The Crit provides a challenging course for racers and a great environment for spectators to enjoy the race.

The Bannock St Criterium is a premier race for licensed racers in Colorado and the USA, sanctioned by the Bicycle Racing Association of Colorado (BRAC) and USA Cycling.

The race is promoted by the Front Rangers Cycling Club, with support from the Naked Women’s Racing Team.  The net proceeds benefit the Front Rangers Cycling Club’s program to bring cycling to urban youth.

The Bannock Street Criterium is honored to present the 2018 BRAC Junior Criterium Championship races, showcasing youth racers ages 9-18.
